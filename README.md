# Firebase Asynchronous Data Access Error

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, error when working with Firebase's asynchronous data retrieval methods. The error arises from attempting to access properties of a document snapshot before the asynchronous operation has completed, leading to a `TypeError`. 

## Problem
The issue stems from the asynchronous nature of `db.collection().doc().get()`.  The promise returned by `.get()` might not resolve immediately. Accessing snapshot properties before resolution results in undefined values and a TypeError.

## Solution
The solution involves correctly handling the asynchronous operation using `.then()` to ensure the data is available before attempting to access it.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Firebase (refer to Firebase documentation).
3. Set up your Firebase project and configure credentials (see Firebase documentation for more details).
4. Replace placeholder values with your project's data.
