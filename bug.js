The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has been fully populated. This can happen if you're using asynchronous functions and trying to access the data before the promise resolves.  For example:

```javascript
db.collection('myCollection').doc('myDoc').get().then((doc) => {
  console.log(doc.data().myProperty); // Error if data is not yet loaded
});
```
This might not show up as a typical Firebase error message, but rather as a 'TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'myProperty')' or a similar Javascript error.
